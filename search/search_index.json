Its long-term goals: to accurately call CpG sites within whole-genome and cell-free DNA fragments, to perform deconvolution for CpG calls within cell-free DNA fragments, and to boldly identify differentially methylated regions like no pipeline before! Overview \u00b6 Welcome to methyl-seek's documentation! This guide is the main source of documentation for users that are getting started with the methylation pipeline . The ./methyl-seek pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions: methyl-seek run Run the methyl-seek pipeline with your input files. methyl-seek unlock Unlocks a previous runs output directory. methyl-seek install Download remote reference files locally. methyl-seek cache Cache remote software containers locally. methyl-seek is a comprehensive bisulphite-sequencing-based DNA methylation pipeline. It relies on technologies like Singularity 1 to maintain the highest level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by Snakemake 2 , a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster. The pipeline is compatible with data generated from Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. As inputs , it accepts a set of FastQ files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users. Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the usage section of each available sub-command. For more information about issues or troubleshooting a problem, please check out our FAQ prior to opening an issue on Github . Dependencies \u00b6 Requires: singularity>=3.5 snakemake<8.0 At the current moment, the pipeline uses a mixture of environment modules and docker images; however, this will be changing soon! In the very near future, the pipeline will only use docker images. With that being said, snakemake and singularity must be installed on the target system. Snakemake orchestrates the execution of each step in the pipeline. To guarantee the highest level of reproducibility, each step of the pipeline will rely on versioned images from DockerHub . Snakemake uses singularity to pull these images onto the local filesystem prior to job execution, and as so, snakemake and singularity will be the only two dependencies in the future.

Optional arguments are shown in square brackets. A user must provide a list of FastQ (globbing is supported) to analyze via --input argument and an output directory to store results via --output argument. Use you can always use the -h option for information on a specific command. 2.1 Required arguments \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are required. Failure to provide a required argument will result in a non-zero exit-code. --input INPUT [INPUT ...] Input FastQ or BAM file(s). type: file(s) One or more FastQ files can be provided. The pipeline does NOT support single-end data. From the command-line, each input file should seperated by a space. Globbing is supported! This makes selecting FastQ files easy. Input FastQ files should always be gzipp-ed. Example: --input .tests/*.R?.fastq.gz --output OUTPUT Path to an output directory. type: path This location is where the pipeline will create all of its output files, also known as the pipeline's working directory. If the provided output directory does not exist, it will be created automatically. Example: --output /data/$USER/methyl-seek_out 2.2 Analysis options \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are optional, and do not need to be provided. ...add non-required analysis options 2.3 Orchestration options \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are optional, and do not need to be provided. --dry-run Dry run the pipeline. type: boolean flag Displays what steps in the pipeline remain or will be run. Does not execute anything! Example: --dry-run --silent Silence standard output. type: boolean flag Reduces the amount of information directed to standard output when submitting master job to the job scheduler. Only the job id of the master job is returned. Example: --silent --mode {slurm,local} Execution Method. type: string default: slurm Execution Method. Defines the mode or method of execution. Vaild mode options include: slurm or local. slurm The slurm execution method will submit jobs to the SLURM workload manager . It is recommended running methyl-seek in this mode as execution will be significantly faster in a distributed environment. This is the default mode of execution. local Local executions will run serially on compute instance. This is useful for testing, debugging, or when a users does not have access to a high performance computing environment. If this option is not provided, it will default to a local execution mode. Example: --mode slurm --job-name JOB_NAME Set the name of the pipeline's master job. type: string default: pl:methyl-seek When submitting the pipeline to a job scheduler, like SLURM, this option always you to set the name of the pipeline's master job. By default, the name of the pipeline's master job is set to \"pl:methyl-seek\". Example: --job-name pl_id-42 --singularity-cache SINGULARITY_CACHE Overrides the $SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR environment variable. type: path default: --output OUTPUT/.singularity Singularity will cache image layers pulled from remote registries. This ultimately speeds up the process of pull an image from DockerHub if an image layer already exists in the singularity cache directory. By default, the cache is set to the value provided to the --output argument. Please note that this cache cannot be shared across users. Singularity strictly enforces you own the cache directory and will return a non-zero exit code if you do not own the cache directory! See the --sif-cache option to create a shareable resource. Example: --singularity-cache /data/$USER/.singularity --sif-cache SIF_CACHE Path where a local cache of SIFs are stored. type: path Uses a local cache of SIFs on the filesystem. This SIF cache can be shared across users if permissions are set correctly. If a SIF does not exist in the SIF cache, the image will be pulled from Dockerhub and a warning message will be displayed. The methyl-seek cache subcommand can be used to create a local SIF cache. Please see methyl-seek cache for more information. This command is extremely useful for avoiding DockerHub pull rate limits. It also remove any potential errors that could occur due to network issues or DockerHub being temporarily unavailable. We recommend running methyl-seek with this option when ever possible. Example: --singularity-cache /data/$USER/SIFs --threads THREADS Max number of threads for each process. type: int default: 2 Max number of threads for each process. This option is more applicable when running the pipeline with --mode local . It is recommended setting this vaule to the maximum number of CPUs available on the host machine. Example: --threads 12 --tmp-dir TMP_DIR Max number of threads for each process. type: path default: /lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID Path on the file system for writing temporary output files. By default, the temporary directory is set to '/lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID' for backwards compatibility with the NIH's Biowulf cluster; however, if you are running the pipeline on another cluster, this option will need to be specified. Ideally, this path should point to a dedicated location on the filesystem for writing tmp files. On many systems, this location is set to somewhere in /scratch. If you need to inject a variable into this string that should NOT be expanded, please quote this options value in single quotes. Example: --tmp-dir /scratch/$USER/ 2.4 Miscellaneous options \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are optional, and do not need to be provided. -h, --help Display Help. type: boolean flag Shows command's synopsis, help message, and an example command Example: --help 3.
