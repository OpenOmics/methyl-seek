### Resources

This folder, `resources/`, is meant to contain all resources necessary for running the workflow. This can be small reference files, such as reference sequences or small databases. This directory also contains utility scripts or wrappers to help facilitate running the pipeline.

Whenever feasible, they can also be downloaded programmatically via rules defined in the pipeline.
